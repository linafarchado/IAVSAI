       "'Basically there are many categories of \" Best Seller \" . Replace \" Best Seller \" by something like \" Oscars \" and every \" best seller \" book is basically an \" oscar - winning \" book . May not have won the \" Best film \" , but even if you won the best director or best script , you \\'re still an \" oscar - winning \" film . Same thing for best sellers . Also , IIRC the rankings change every week or something like that . Some you might not be best seller one week , but you may be the next week . I guess even if you do n\\'t stay there for long , you still achieved the status . Hence , # 1 best seller . If you \\'re hearing about it , it \\'s because it was a very good or very well - publicized book ( or both ) , and almost every good or well - publicized book will be # 1 on the NY Times bestseller list for at least a little bit . Kindof like how almost every big or good movies are # 1 at the box office on their opening weekend . One reason is lots of catagories . However , how the NY Times calculates its best seller list is n\\'t comprehensive , and is pretty well understood by publishers . So publishers can [ buy a few books ] ( URL_0 ) in the right bookstores and send a book to the top of the list for at least a week . salt is good for not dying in car crashes and car crashes are worse for cars then salt . Some places use other things , but salt is really cheap compared to most alternatives , although sand is pretty good . In Minnesota and North Dakota , they tend to use sand , not salt . In these states , though , it is cold enough that the salt can not actually melt the snow , and so it refreezes and you end up with black ice on the roads , which is counterproductive . In other states whether there is snow but not so cold , wet asphalt is better than gritty snow for traction and so salt is favored for safety . Most people who live in states where salt is used , and by the way also in coastal cities , know that washing the car a couple times a week is critical . Used to work in the salt industry ( yes , it \\'s a thing ) . Salt is one of the cheapest substances on earth . As in , you \\'d be getting ripped off if you paid more than $ 150 per metric ton . ( In fact , the largest component of salt \\'s price is actually shipping . Yes , it costs more to transport salt than it does to produce it . ) Salt does its job ( lowering the freezing point of water ) incredibly effectively and is ludicrously abundant in nature . Its crystalline structure can also be manipulated in order to have sharper edges that reduce bounce . So that allows it to stick evenly to critical surfaces such as roads . Yes , there are alternatives . Usually salt / gravel mix or sugar beet based solutions . Those have less of an environmental impact when the spring melt washes it into the drain . This is more used in places where balance of water salinity for the safety of aquatic life is important . Propylene glycol , a water displacer , is even used in some places where it \\'s so cold that salt wo n\\'t work effectively . But salt is by far the cheapest , most effective solution for preventing the icing of roads . And your government wants above all cheap and effective solutions that reduce winter accidents and keep people safe . They do n\\'t care as much about the finish on your 1994 Honda Prelude . The way it works is that old TV stations got a certain amount of bandwidth to replace their old analog TV stations . However , HD takes up more bandwidth then SD - so the stations can choose between 2 or 3 HD stations , or like 7 or 8 SD stations ( or a mix of both ) They can do a bunch of SD stations and make more money in advertizing by running 7 or 8 different reruns of old SD TV shows at a time In fact , those stations often got permanent rights to show an unlimited number of reruns of old syndicated shows in perpetuity . That means they do n\\'t even have to pay anyone to air old eppisodes of _ Star Trek _ or _ Alf _ So basically it \\'s free money for them , based on being around for a long , long time and having their old rights get upgraded as new technology comes out . HD does n\\'t look like anything at all on an SD TV . An old SD television ca n\\'t even process the HD signal . We still have SD channels because there are still SD televisions out there . There are a few reasons why SD channels still exist : 1 ) SD channels typically consume much less bandwidth than HD channels , so it is possible to carry many more SD channels than HD channels over the same coaxial cable or wireless spectrum ( for antenna broadcasts ) . This point does not apply when a television service provider carries both HD and SD versions of the same channel though . 2 ) Broadcasts formatted for HDTVs ( in 16x9 aspect ratio ) will typically have important details / information cut - off if displayed on an older 4:3 television screens . The SD - specific channels are often formatted especially for older 4:3 screens so that important graphics / information / details etc . do n\\'t get cut - off . 3 ) Not all TVs / tuners are capable of receiving HD broadcasts even though they may be capable of receiving digital SD broadcasts . 4 ) With respect to cable TV , some cable companies still carry analog SD channels which can be received by older television sets without the need of a digital - to - analog adapter . If everything was switched to digital / HD , older televisions would need to be outfitted with a special adapter in order to receive service ( which is already the case in some areas ) . 5 ) A few televisions stations ( typically local / low - budget stations ) are still using old cameras , video processing and transmission equipment from the 90s or early 2000s and have n\\'t yet invested in upgrading their equipment to support HD broadcasts . You ca n\\'t just go around assassinating the leaders of countries you do nt like ! The international condemnation would be brutal . Even though noone likes Kim Jong - Un , and everyone thinks North Korea is pretty shitty to its citizens , if say the US were to send agents over ( and do n\\'t think they are n\\'t capable of it ) and they got caught .... every country , every world leader would be a potential target . Who \\'s next ... Castro ? Angela Merkel ? Anyways , rumour has it that he \\'s ultra paranoid about exactly that and travels around in tanks and armoured trains that make Limo 1 look like a tonka toy . It would n\\'t really do any good . It \\'s not like North Korea would instantly convert to freedom - loving democracy if he died . Partly because any country found to be doing so would incur China \\'s wrath , and generally look bad to the international community . Partly because destabilizing a government that has nuclear weapons is probably not a good idea . And partly because it likely is n\\'t as easy as it sounds . Wanting to kill the shit out of Germans drives innovation . This is a frequent phenomenon with technology : something is considered very hard or even impossible for a long , long time , and then one day , somebody figures it out . That opens a whole FLOODGATE of discovery leading to discovery , and the technology leaps forward quickly . Eventually , those chains of discovery start to play out , and the rate of advancement slows down , and may even come to a halt , perhaps starting up again years later when somebody discovers something new . We saw the same phenomenon with the building of the first transistor in 1947 . The * theory * of transistors had actually been known since the early 20th century , but nobody had figured out a way to actually build one . That led to an explosion in electronics , and when somebody figured out how to put a shitload of teensy transistors on a silicon wafer , the explosion exploded . The importance of the Wright Brothers and other early inventors was to prove it could be done . Once proven , the rest is just a process of incremental improvements that add up over time . Keep in mind that while there are lots of nifty stuff in modern aircraft , the biggest thing in my opinion that makes modern aircraft possible are the engines and the only major change from 100 years ago has been from piston to turbine . Every other engine development is just making what we had the year before , a bit better , a bit lighter , a bit more powerful , a bit more reliable .'"
